Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast hazard ratings for maintenance projects. The dataset provided contains various attributes related to manual crew tasks in heavy equipment maintenance. Each task has been assigned a hazard score, which is utilized to determine safety measures and precautions during the maintenance process. The task is to build a machine learning model using the training dataset to predict hazard scores for the corresponding tasks in the test dataset. The model's performance will be evaluated based on the mean absolute error (MAE) on the test dataset.
